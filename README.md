# Hi, my name is Johannes Christel :)

### Backend (and sometimes Frontend) Developer

I started coding late in school and during my apprenticeship at my first programming job.  
My first steps were a few simpler UI-Design tasks but quickly noticed that the system design and implementation in the backend is where my passion is at.  

At my workplace, I am currently part of a couple projects where I can learn from more experienced developers about application how design applications. Right now I have not much to my name to show for. After all, I am still a Junior with much to learn.
